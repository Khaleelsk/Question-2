# Question-2
Build a NodeJS backend API to calculate the nth element from the Fibonacci series of a given number. A Fibonacci Series is a series where an element is calculated by the sum of itâ€™s previous two elements. We can assume using the combinatorial definition of this series, starting from 1. The series is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, .... Here, for example, the term fib(13) = 337, which is made by the addition of fib(12) and fib (11) which is 233 and 144 respectively. Your task is to take the number and return the element corresponding to that index from the fibonacci series. Remember, indexes start from 0. So, fib(0) will be 1, fib(1) will be 1, fib(2) will be 2, fib(3) will be 3, fib(4) will be 5, fib(5) will be 8, fib(6) will be 13 and so on. This application should have an GET endpoint taking the n input as a query parameter. It should be <YOUR_HOSTED_URL>/fibonacci?n=XX. Here your hosted URL you will get after hosting your NodeJS application to Heroku and XX will be the number which will be given as input for the query parameter n.
